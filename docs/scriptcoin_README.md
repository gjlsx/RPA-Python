# Project Documentation: Quantitative Strategy Input Page

This directory contains documentation for the Quantitative Strategy Input Page application.

## Documents

- **[Requirements Specification (`requirements.md`)](./requirements.md):** Details the functional and non-functional requirements for the application.
- **[High-Level Design (`design.md`)](./design.md):** Outlines the architecture and roles of the different components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

This application allows users to input a financial asset identifier (stock code, crypto symbol, or wallet address), select an existing quantitative trading strategy or define a custom one, and submit this information.

The primary files for this application are:
- `indexcoin.html`: The main HTML file structuring the page.
- `stylecoin.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.
- `scriptcoin.js`: The JavaScript file for page interactivity and logic.
